# A basic DeepLearning project for the Wisconsin breast cancer diagnosis data. The data was downloaded from Kaggle.

In this repository you will find the jupyter notebook file with the details on how to create your first neural network using this datasets. You will find the .csv files and also the model I created from this work.

This work has used the models from Keras, but I will be posting more work that correlates to Chemistry and Biology using other modules.
